\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Current \acp{spe} can process terabytes of incoming data per second~\cite[]{alibaba}.
Because widely used \acp{spe} such as Apache Flink and Spark Streaming do not fully utilize the underlying hardware and are resource inefficient~\cite[]{DBLP:conf/icde/ZhangHDZH17,DBLP:journals/pvldb/ZeuchBRMKLRTM19}, the implementation of recent \acp{spe} shifted towards system languages such as C and C++. 
This increased their throughput by up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art SPEs~\cite[]{DBLP:journals/pvldb/ZeuchBRMKLRTM19}.

However, along with these performance gains, the bottlenecks of SPEs have also shifted.
In particular, it has become apparent that memory and not CPU performance is the new bottleneck for many queries~\cite[]{bollmeier2021processor}.

The shift to system languages also brings \acp{spe} much closer to classical database systems, which are usually also implemented system languages.
One trend observed in classical database systems in recent years is the introduction of more and more column-oriented database systems, like MonetDB~\cite[]{DBLP:journals/debu/IdreosGNMMK12,DBLP:conf/cidr/BonczZN05,DBLP:journals/vldb/BonczK99}, C-Store~\cite[]{DBLP:conf/vldb/StonebrakerABCCFLLMOORTZ05} or SAP HANA~\cite[]{DBLP:conf/sigmod/SikkaFLCPB12}
They work around the same memory bottleneck we now observe for \acp{spe}~\cite[]{DBLP:conf/vldb/BonczMK99} by accessing memory for efficiently~\cite[]{DBLP:conf/sigmod/AbadiMH08} which makes them ultimately faster than row-based database systems.

However, this column-based store seems inherently incompatible with true streaming, which assumes processing one tuple at a time.
However, this understanding no longer corresponds to the truth, since tuples arrive at least in mini-batches corresponding to the size of network packets and \acp{spe} process them as is.
Accordingly, it is interesting to investigate how a column-oriented \ac{spe} performs against a row-based one (or even hybrid forms).
With MonetDB/Datacell~\cite[]{DBLP:journals/pvldb/LiarouIMK12} and Trill~\cite[]{DBLP:journals/pvldb/ChandramouliGBDPTW14}, two \acp{spe} have been designed in recent years that operate on a column-store.
Of particular interest is how the characteristics of the queries and tuples influence the performance.
